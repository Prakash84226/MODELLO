            <p>Clothes help to keep people ready for whatever they may face in life but fashion keeps up with the current crazes and changes that we all so that we're ready for whatever life throws our way. Fashion can also be a part of people's culture.</p>

                <p>Fashion is unique, self-fulfilling and may be a key part of someone's identity. Similarly to art, the aims of a person's choices in fashion are not necessarily to be liked by everyone, but instead to be an expression of personal taste.</p>
                <div class="para">
                    <p>“To me fashion is a way to express yourself to others. Anyone who tells you it doesn't matter what you look like to others is mistaken. It does matter. Dressing well can unlock doors for you in both your personal and professional life. Fashion is a way to empower yourself and influence others.”</p>
